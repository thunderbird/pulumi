Getting Started
===============

To use this module, you'll need to get through this checklist first:

* Ensure Python 3.12 or greater is installed on your system.
* `Install Pulumi <https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/>`_.
* Understand the `basic concepts of Pulumi <https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/>`_.
* `Configure awscli <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html>`_ with
  your credentials and default region. (You do not have to install awscli, though you can
  `read how to here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html>`_.
  Some of these docs refer to helpful awscli commands.)
* Create a directory which will contain your implementation of these patterns.
* Add a reference to a version of this module to your project's requirements. This should look
  something like this: ``git+https://github.com/thunderbird/pulumi.git@v0.0.2``
