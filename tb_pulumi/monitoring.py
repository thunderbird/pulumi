class MonitoringGroup(tb_pulumi.ThunderbirdComponentResource):
    """A broad-scope approach to aggregate resource monitoring. A ``MonitoringGroup`` is a very thin class that should
    be extended to provide specific monitoring solutions for the resources contained in the specified ``project``.

    :param pulumi_type: The "type" string (commonly referred to in docs as just ``t``) of the component as described
        by `Pulumi's type docs <https://www.pulumi.com/docs/concepts/resources/names/#types>`_.

    :param project: The ``ThunderbirdPulumiProject`` to build monitoring resources for.
    :type project: tb_pulumi.ThunderbirdPulumiProject

    :param type_map: A dict where the keys are ``pulumi.Resource`` derivatives representing types of resources this
        monitoring group recognizes, and where the values are ``tb_pulumi.monitoring.AlarmGroup`` derivatives which
        actually declare those monitors. For example, an ``aws.cloudfront.Distribution`` key might map to a
        ``tb_pulumi.cloudwatch.CloudFrontDistributionAlarmGroup`` value.
    :type type_map: dict[type, type]

    :param config: A configuration dictionary. The specific format and content of this dictionary is defined in part by
        classes extending this class. However, the dictionary should be configured in the following broad way, with
        downstream monitoring groups defining the specifics of the monitor configs (shown here as YAML):

        .. code-block:: yaml
            :linenos:

            ---
            alarms:
                name-of-the-resource-being-monitored:
                    monitor_name:
                        enabled: False
                        # Downstream monitoring groups tell you what else goes right here

        This config defines override settings for alarms whose default configurations are insufficient for a specific
        use case. Since each resource can have multiple alarms associated with it, the ``"alarm"`` dict's keys should be
        the names of Pulumi resources being monitored. Their values should also be dictionaries, and those keys should
        be the names of the alarms as defined in the documentation for those alarm groups.

        All alarms should respond to a boolean ``"enabled"`` value such that the alarm will not be created if this is
        ``False``. Beyond that, configure each alarm as described in its alarm group documentation. Defaults to {}.
    :type config: dict, optional

    :param opts: Additional ``pulumi.ResourceOptions`` to apply to this resource. Defaults to None.

            """Not all items in a project's ``resources`` dict are actually Pulumi Resources. Sometimes we build
            resources downstream of a Pulumi Output, which makes those resources (as they are known to the project)
            actually Outputs and not recognizable resource types. We can only detect what kind of thing those Outputs
            really are by asking from within code called inside an output's `apply` function. This necessitates an
            unpacking process on this end of things to recursively resolve those Outputs into Resources that we can
            build alarms around.

            This function processes and recursively "unpacks" an ``item`` , which could be any of the following things:

                - A Pulumi Resource that we may or may not be able to monitor.
                - A ``tb_pulumi.ThunderbirdComponentResource`` that potentially contains other Resources or Outputs
                    in a potentially nested structure.
                - A Pulumi Output that could represent either of the above things, or could be a collection of a
                    combination of those things.
                - A list of any of the above items.
                - A dict where the values could be any of the above items.

            Given one of these things, this function determines what kind of item it's dealing with and responds
            appropriately to unpack and resolve the item. The function doesn't return any value, but instead manipulates
            the internal resource listing directly, resulting in an ``all_resources`` list that includes the unpacked
            and resolved Outputs.

            It is important to note that this listing is **eventually resolved**. Because this function deals in Pulumi
            Outputs, the ``all_resources`` list **will still contain Outputs, even after running this function!**
            However, ``all_resources`` will contain valid, resolved values when accessed from within a function that
            relies upon the application of every item in ``all_outputs``, such as the ``monitor`` function. This is why
            we build all monitoring resources inside of the ``monitor`` function.
